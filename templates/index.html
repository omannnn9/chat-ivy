      <p class="bio">
        This is Ivy â€” a smart, modern financial assistant designed to make loan-related information accessible, friendly, and easy to understand. Created by Oman, a 19-year-old with a passion for building helpful digital tools, Ivy was born out of the belief that financial knowledge should be simple and approachable for everyone. Whether it's understanding what a loan is, how APR works, or calculating repayments, Ivy is equipped with both real-time AI capabilities and a comprehensive offline knowledge base to provide detailed answers at any time. With a clean interface, dark theme, and smooth experience, Ivy makes financial conversations feel less intimidating and more like a helpful chat. Users can type naturally â€” even casually â€” and get clear, accurate responses that are easy to digest. Ivy is designed to be interactive, mobile-friendly, and future-ready, complete with optional 3D visuals and emoji support. Whether online or offline, the goal is always the same: help people learn more about loans and make informed decisions without the stress. Ivy is not just a chatbot â€” itâ€™s a small step toward better financial literacy for the next generation.
