  "what is apr": "APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate 💡 — it's the *real* cost of borrowing money over a year. It includes the interest rate *plus* any extra fees or charges. So if you're comparing loans, the APR gives you the **true total cost** 📊. Lower APR = better deal, always! 😉",
  "difference between apr and interest rate": "Think of **interest rate** as just the base price 🏷️ for borrowing money, while **APR** is the all-in price 🍕 (interest + fees). APR is what you *actually* pay yearly, so it’s better for comparing loans. Don't get fooled by a low rate that hides fees! 😎",
  "what is a loan": "A loan is 💸 money you borrow from a bank or lender — and agree to pay back with interest 📆. People take loans for houses, cars, studies, and even businesses. It's like a financial booster pack — but make sure you read the fine print! 📃",
  "types of loans": "You've got options! 🧠 \n- **Personal loans** (flexible use)\n- **Student loans** (college cash 🎓)\n- **Car loans** (vroom vroom 🚗)\n- **Home loans** (a.k.a. mortgages 🏠)\n- **Business loans** (start that empire 💼)\n- **Payday loans** (avoid these if you can ⚠️).",
  "what is emi": "**EMI** = Equated Monthly Installment 💳. It's a fixed payment you make each month to repay a loan. It includes both interest *and* a portion of the original amount you borrowed. Think of it as your monthly rent to the bank 😅.",
  "credit score": "Your **credit score** is like your financial reputation score 📈. It ranges from 300 to 850, and the higher the better. Good credit = better loan offers, lower APRs, more trust 🤝. Pay on time and don’t max out your cards! 💳✅",
  "secured loan": "A **secured loan** is backed by something valuable (like your car 🚗 or house 🏠). If you don’t pay, the lender can take it. Because there's less risk for the lender, secured loans usually have lower interest rates! 📉",
  "unsecured loan": "An **unsecured loan** doesn’t require collateral. It’s all based on your credit score and trust 🤞. Higher risk for the lender = higher interest rate. But no car or house on the line! 🆓",
  "monthly payment calculation": "I use the **amortization formula** 🧮 to calculate how much you'll pay monthly:\nP = [A * r] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]\nWhere:\n- A = loan amount\n- r = monthly interest rate\n- n = number of months\nI’ve got you — just tell me the amount, rate, and time 🕒.",
  "loan vs mortgage": "**All mortgages are loans**, but not all loans are mortgages 😅. A mortgage is a special type of loan for buying property 🏡. It's usually bigger, longer-term, and uses the house itself as collateral.",
  "how to reduce apr": "Wanna flex a lower APR? 💪 Here's how:\n1. Boost your credit score 📈\n2. Choose a shorter term 📆\n3. Shop around 🛒\n4. Avoid sketchy lenders 🚫\n5. Watch for hidden fees 🕵️‍♀️",
  "how does ivy calculate loan": "I use the standard amortized loan formula to calculate your monthly payments 📐. That way I can give you a solid estimate instantly!",
  "example apr": "Sure! 🧠 Let’s say you borrow $1,000 at 10% interest plus a $50 fee. Your APR will be higher than 10% because it includes that fee. If you paid it back in 1 year, your APR might be around 15%!",
  "example loan": "Okay, let’s say you borrow $5,000 at 6% for 2 years. Your monthly payment would be about $221.60. That includes interest! The total paid over time = ~$5,318. Boom 💥",
  "example": "Examples? I gotchu! 💅 Just tell me what topic — like APR, loans, or credit — and I’ll drop a brain snack.",
